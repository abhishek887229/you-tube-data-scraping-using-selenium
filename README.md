# You-Tube data scraping using selenium

**Introduction**
this project is a youtube comment scrapper which is able to scrap comments from youtube videos, you can extract comments for any video, most web pages including youtube are dynamic they change automatically so due to this I use Selenium which is a powerful tool for it. choose and insert the name of the video wisely because it is programmed to scrap the 1st video's comment from the search list.

**requirment**
- Python 3.11.3
- selenium 4.10.0

**How to Use**


1) first step is to clone the project while using the command 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishek887229/CRUD-Application-Django.git
```
the command written above will make a clone of project in local machine

2) run the program using the name of the file
```bash
python3 <name of file with extension>
```

3) put the keyword or full name of the video want to scrap

```bash 

search.send_keys(" ")
```

in the  send key put the name or keyword of the video you want to scrap it will automate the work and at last it will provide a CSV file that contains all the comments. the name of the CSV file will be **you_tube_comment_1.csv**
